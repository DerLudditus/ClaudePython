This is an index of the small Python tutorials posted on [Claude Explains](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-explains) as they were on June 6,
2025, and as they have been retrieved by an imperfect script.

Anthropic has abruptly removed the access to the Claude Explain section of the website by modifying each hosted file at this time stamp:

```
<!-- Last Published: Fri Jun 06 2025 15:31:39 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time) -->
```

by adding this forced redirection:

```<script>
// Redirect all traffic to Anthropic
window.location.replace('https://www.anthropic.com');
</script>
```

All the files are, however, still on the server, and they can be retrieved, e.g., with `wget`. The 129 files retrieved by me are the only ones about Python for which I had the URLs; there might be more of them. Should Anthropic restore access to [Claude Explains](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-explains), everyone could access whatever else is there.

Obviously, I stripped the files of all the garbage inserted there by Anthropic.
